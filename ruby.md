# InventoryService

This is a Ruby on Rails application that provides a database access control layer for the 'inventory' database. It also exposes a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on products.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `app/controllers/application_controller.rb`: This file is the base controller for the application. It defines common methods and configurations that other controllers inherit from.

- `app/controllers/products_controller.rb`: This file is the controller for handling CRUD operations on products. It contains methods for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting products.

- `app/models/application_record.rb`: This file is the base model for the application. It provides the connection to the database and defines common methods and configurations that other models inherit from.

- `app/models/category.rb`: This file is the model for the 'categories' table in the 'inventory' database. It defines the structure and associations of the category data.

- `app/models/product.rb`: This file is the model for the 'products' table in the 'inventory' database. It defines the structure and associations of the product data.

- `app/views/products/index.json.jbuilder`: This file is the view template for rendering a list of products in JSON format.

- `app/views/products/show.json.jbuilder`: This file is the view template for rendering a single product in JSON format.

- `app/views/products/create.json.jbuilder`: This file is the view template for rendering the response after creating a new product in JSON format.

- `config/database.yml`: This file is the configuration file for connecting to the SQL Server 2022 database 'inventory'. It specifies the database connection details.

- `config/routes.rb`: This file is the configuration file for defining the routing entries of the RESTful API. It maps the HTTP requests to the corresponding controller actions.

- `config/initializers/new_framework_defaults.rb`: This file contains the configuration settings for the Rails framework.

- `db/migrate/create_categories.rb`: This file is a database migration file for creating the 'categories' table in the 'inventory' database.

- `db/migrate/create_products.rb`: This file is a database migration file for creating the 'products' table in the 'inventory' database.

- `db/schema.rb`: This file is the database schema file generated by Rails. It represents the current structure of the database.

- `Gemfile`: This file lists the required gems (libraries) for the project. It specifies the dependencies of the project.

- `Gemfile.lock`: This file is automatically generated by Bundler. It locks the versions of the installed gems to ensure consistent dependencies.

- `Rakefile`: This file is used for defining tasks that can be run with the rake command.

## API Endpoints

The API exposes the following routing entries:

- `GET /productsByCategory/:id`: Returns a list of all products in a given category.

- `GET /products/:id`: Returns a single product by id.

- `POST /products`: Creates a new product.

- `PUT /products/:id`: Updates an existing product.

Please refer to the controller file `app/controllers/products_controller.rb` for the implementation details of these endpoints.

## Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required gems by running `bundle install` in the project directory.

2. Configure the database connection in the `config/database.yml` file.

3. Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables by running `rails db:migrate`.

4. Start the Rails server by running `rails server`.

You can now access the API endpoints and perform CRUD operations on the products.
